This repository contains the code created for my Thesis. 

It includes python code for preprocessing as well as code to inference images based on the models. 

It also includes config files, which stem from the tool MMDetection. MMDetection uses a modular design, all modules with different functions can be configured through the config. 
The config files included in this repository were used to train, validate and test the models.
They were also used to make certain changes for the experiments conducted in the research, such as testing hyperparameters, resizing the images, and altering the pre-training dataset.
