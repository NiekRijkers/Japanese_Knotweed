This repository contains the code created for my Thesis. 

It includes python code for preprocessing the image annotations as well as code to inference images based on the models. 

It also includes config files, which stem from the tool MMDetection. 
MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch.
MMDetection uses a modular design, all modules with different functions can be configured through the config. 
Thus, config files can be created to customize the functions from MMDetection.
The config files included in this repository were used to train, validate and test the models.
They were also used for the experiments conducted in the research. Such as resizing the images, altering the pre-training datasets, and hyperparameter testing.
